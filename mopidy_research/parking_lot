# Parking Lot is a place for all ideas/thoughts. 

Thoughts:
- Need to create guide for installing modipy and necessary extensions on the repo
- Need to add documentation to repo
- Need to create a conf file to overright the given conf file
	- Maybe two conf files, one for mopidy, one for iris/web client
- Iris: can we over right graphical settings without rewritting the entire extension?
- what does the spotify ext need? How do those needs get filled?
- what is emmanuals stuff for? what does it do? what are the steps of this project? What has already been accomplished?
	- How does everything work?! 
- can we make this a simple install for the rasberry pi? like one command?
- how do raspberry pi's work? do they have internet access? what's the interface on them? 


Future thoughts: 
- creating a local file system for saving songs/creating playlits/etc
